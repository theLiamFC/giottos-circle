This code is written to aid in the control of a 2dof robot arm.

The Giotto class is initialized with the length of both robot arms and returns 2 motor angles.

You can change the priority of the robot arm using Giotto.mode = "efficiency","low","high","left","right".
This parameter will alter which direction the class attempts to keep the arm in.
